Simple Wireless Natural User Interface (Final Degree Project)

Inside the world of electronics there is a large diversity of fields, from among all, in this Final Degree Project, we will focus in the ambit of the human-machine interaction.

We will proceed then, to perform the prototype of a simple natural user interface that is able to make a wireless communication with an extern system, in our case a PC. To do that, we will use a microcontroller based system that will process the acquired reads from an accelerometer and determines the gesture accomplished to transmit it later through a Bluetooth link to the reception system.

In that way, we will start by implementing the hardware design of the system, designing the electrical schematic and the CAD design of the printed circuit board (by using the Eagle software), manufacturing the board and doing the components solder process. Once completed the hardware of the system we will continue with the software design, at both side of the system: the prototype manufactured and the extern system (PC), that allows verify the correct functionality of the system.

Complementary to the hardware and software development, we will work out the 3D model of the prototype enclosure (by using the Freecad software).
